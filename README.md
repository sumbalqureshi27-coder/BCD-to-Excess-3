# BCD to Excess-3 Converter

This project converts Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) inputs into Excess-3 code by adding binary 0011 using a 4-bit adder in Proteus.  
It includes the truth table, hand calculations, and simulation results verifying correct output for all valid BCD inputs (0â€“9).

## Features
- BCD to Excess-3 conversion logic
- 4-bit adder implementation (74LS283)
- Verified Proteus simulation

## Tools Used
- Proteus 8 Professional
- Digital Logic Components (74LS283, switches, LEDs)
